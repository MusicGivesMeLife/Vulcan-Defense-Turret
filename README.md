#Vulcan Defense Turret
##Description
A program to automate a NERF Vulcan to attack anyone who dares approach it.  I'm putting the code here so others can use it and so I don't accidentally delete it again.
##Raspberry Pi Service
A python script to monitor the Arduino and handle higher-level logic (tking embarassing video clips of the startled victims and shouting "EXTERMINATE!!!!!" at them in a Dalek voice)
##Arduino Relay Control Program
I got a little bored and actually made this a program that can completely control all four relays on the shield over serial, and report the inputs on digital pins (the motion sensor for this application)
